for now to open the game in the site you need to:

+ download the BIRD.jsdos from my github reposetory here.

+ open the link from above ☝️

+ than press play and press on the button at the middle, insert the BIRD.jsdos file there and press play.

+ press esc to see what are all the game mechanics

later I'll make it work automatically (maybe).

THE SITE ONLY WORKS IN PC FOR NOW

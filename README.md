for now to open the game in the site you need to download the BIRD.jsdos from my github reposetory here. than press play and press on the button at the middle, insert the BIRD.jsdos file there and press play.
later i will make it work automatically (maybe).

THE SITE ONLY WORKS IN PC FOR NOW

How The Game Looks Like:
